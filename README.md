# Description
Simple, Node.js based, Minecraft server manager
Written just for fun, will probably update it.
Tested on Linux, I'm not sure it will work on Windows.
Server directory will be customizable in the future, for now it just uses an internal directory
`minecraft-manager` command must be executed in the script directory

STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
